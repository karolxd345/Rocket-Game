# Rocket-Game
This is my first game made with Unity in C#




<-- Release 1.0 -->


It's the first released version of the game.
You can steer the rotation of the rocket with left and right arrows, and add thrust with space.
There are 3 levels, with the levels getting higher the length of the path and power of the thrust are going to be higher.
At the and of the last level, there'll be a longer break before it'll restart the game.
There've not been implemented any additional moving obstacles, so it might be harder to pass in the future.
Have fun playing my first game!

<<--- FULL GAME --->>

This game reached it's end.
For now, the game won't be supported in the future.
I really enjoyed working on this game, so -I suppose- you did playing this game.
It's the end of this game, but I will be making more games; to play more of my games watch my repos, bc there might be more games made by me.
